        RBN rewards its eligible Members for residential home sales or purchases. These rewards are offered in collaboration with licensed real estate Brokers and Participating Loyalty Providers. All real estate brokerage components of this program are managed and offered directly by these participating real estate Brokerages in cooperation with RBN Realty, an Arizona Brokerage owned by RBN LLC. The cost to provide rewards is collected from participating licensed real estate Brokers. Real estate broker fees may apply. RBN Rewards are based on the participating agent's commission rate associated with the sold or purchased home. Real estate commission rates are negotiable and may vary, therefore point value may also vary.  Market availability, participating partners and available rewards are subject to change without notice. RBN Rewards are not available in all markets or where prohibited by law and may be subject to lender approval.  Rewards are currently available as American Express Membership Rewards&reg; Points on eligible American Express Cards.  Customers must connect and partner with an RBN participating agent through the RBN platform to be eligible to earn rewards.  RBN respects existing contractual obligations with agents and their clients. Customers with existing agent agreements are not eligible to earn RBN Rewards.
